# Jackal v1.1.2 Upgrade Guide

## Installing New Binary

Clone the Jackal repo

```
git clone https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain.git
cd canine-chain
```
Checkout the upgrade version

```
git fetch
git checkout v1.1.2-hotfix
```

Build the binary

```
make build
```

The resulting binary will be `canine-chain/build/canined`

## Starting the Blockchain

### Cosmovisor Method

Ensure your chain is at the following block height: 45381

**If you halted your chain early, this may not be the case. I recommend following the Canined upgrade below any situation where your node is not already at the halt height.**

Copy the new binary in place of the existing genesis cosmovisor binary

```
cp $(which canined) $HOME/.canine/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/canined
```

### Traditonal Method
Set the halt height in the canined app config
```
sed -i.bak 's/halt-height = 0/halt-height = 45381/' $HOME/.canine/config/app.toml
```

Wait until the planned upgrade time (Nov 7 2022, 15:00 UTC)

At the uprgade time, run the binary to ensure the node syncs to the halt height

```
canined start
```

Once it stops due to the halt-height, replace the old canined binary with the new one:

```
cp $HOME/canine-chain/build/canined $(which canined)
```

Remove the halt-height from the config:

```
sed -i.bak 's/halt-height = 45381/halt-height = 0/' $HOME/.canine/config/app.toml
```

Restart the node:

```
canined start
```
