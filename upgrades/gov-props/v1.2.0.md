# v1.2.0.1
## Summary
This upgrade allows the Jackal Network to start fulfilling its purpose as the Decentralized Storage Platform of the 
Cosmos. This upgrade introduces the Storage module, which allows users to pay for storage and create storage deals with 
Storage Providers. It also brings the addition of the Filetree module which creates a privacy layer and bucket file 
structure akin to S3 and Google Drive. Finally, it also brings the addition of the Oracle module which allows other 
modules to query a data stream being supplied by a centralized entity. In this case, Jackal Labs will be using this 
oracle to supply pricing information while the AMM module is being finalized.

The upgrade will take place at block height 2080380, estimated to be on March 23rd. This upgrade marks a crucial 
milestone for the Jackal Protocol and brings it one step closer to achieving the vision of providing a decentralized and 
efficient storage platform for the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond.
