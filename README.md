# Canine Chain
**Canine Chain** is a core component to the Jackal Protocol, a distributed cloud storage platform running on blockchain rails. This component is the replicated state machine that manages storage deals, payments and data-permissions. It is built using the Cosmos-SDK and CometBFT (formerly Tendermint).
